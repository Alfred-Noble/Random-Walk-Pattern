Overview: The Random Walk Turtle project is a Python application that uses the Turtle graphics module to create a random walk pattern.

*Random Walk Turtle Project Description*

The Random Walk Turtle project is a Python application that uses the Turtle graphics module to create a random walk pattern. This project highlights the use of randomization to produce dynamic and visually interesting designs. The simplicity of the code demonstrates how basic Turtle commands can be combined with random number generation to create complex patterns.

Features
1) Random Color Generation: Each step of the random walk is drawn in a randomly selected color, resulting in a vibrant and colorful pattern.
2) Randomized Directions: The turtle moves in random directions (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees) to create an unpredictable path.
3) Adjustable Parameters: The pen size and step length can be easily adjusted to change the appearance of the pattern.
4) Fast Rendering: The turtle's speed is set to the fastest setting to ensure quick and smooth drawing.

User-Defined Functions
1) random_color(): Generates and returns a random RGB color tuple.

Future Enhancements
User Input: Allow users to customize the number of steps, pen size, and step length through command-line inputs or a simple GUI.
Pattern Variations: Introduce different movement patterns and shapes for more diverse graphical effects.
Save Artwork: Add functionality to save the generated patterns as image files for easy sharing and printing.
